### Mission

Our mission is to create a forum for collective innovation in developing software to address geospatial science challenges. We will draw from eScience Institute [working group methodologies](http://escience.washington.edu/working-groups/) to advance the following four goals:

### Training and Education

We will share knowledge in modern software tools aimed at handling increasingly large and complex heliophysics science datasets. Our approach will be to develop templates for best practices in solving common heliophysics data science challenges, built off a set of sample datasets provided during the hackweek. We will learn from leaders in various fields, and use this knowledge to develop educational content that can be shared across disciplines long after the event. Our training will focus on software tools, but we will also explore challenges in successfully navigating complexity in project management and design.

### Networking and Community Building

We will connect students, faculty, software developers and others across industry, government, and academic settings.
The connections we make during the hackweek will be maintained through an online user community. We hope our activities can foster the growth of an interdisciplinary network for solving heliophysics, data science, and AI/machine learning challenges.

### Data Accessibility / Sustaining an Open Source Community

We recognize the challenge of many heliophysics investigations in accessing increasingly large datasets to understand the sun and its interactions with Earth and the solar system, including space weather. We will explore various solutions, including the co-location of datasets with software tools using services provided by commercial cloud and GPU vendors.

### Software Development

We will harness our collective talent assembled during the event to rapidly advance the development of software tools.
