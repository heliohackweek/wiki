The organizers of this event are dedicated to providing a harassment-free learning experience for everyone regardless of gender, gender identity and expression, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, race, ethnicity, age or religion. Hackweek volunteers and organizers will step up to address harassment of participants and/or presenters in any form if we are direct witnesses. 

Harassment includes, but is not limited to:
* Verbal comments that discriminate on the basis of gender, gender identity and expression, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, race, ethnicity, age, religion
* Sexual images in public spaces
* Deliberate intimidation, stalking, or following
* Harassing photography or recording
* Sustained disruption of talks or other events
* Inappropriate physical contact
* Unwelcome sexual attention
* Advocating for, or encouraging, any of the above behavior

We expect participants to act in ways that support a learning community at all event venues and event-related social activities. We expect you to support collaboration and learning while visiting University of Washington's many communities of practice. Participants asked to stop any harassing behavior are expected to comply immediately. Failure to comply may result in the participant being expelled from the event without refund at the discretion of the organizers.

Ways to provide feedback and insights or address unethical or unprofessional behavior at our event:

If you feel comfortable contacting someone associated with our event, you may speak with one of the event organizers in person, send an e-mail to heliohackweek20@gmail.com, or contact an organizer or Project Mentor on a private Slack channel.

If you have experienced or observed harassment, unethical or unprofessional behavior as described above (a violation of this code of conduct) and want to talk to someone not directly associated with our event about it, choose from these specialists below:

* Contact the NASA Goddard Ombuds Office. Website: https://www.nasa.gov/offices/ombuds. Phone: 301.286.7259. 
IMPORTANT: Traditional academic metrics may not fully recognize the many ways individuals contribute to our learning community. In tutorials, projects, group presentations and code repositories, set up a mutually-agreed upon system for attribution of ideas and effort. When in doubt, participants agree to ask each other if they approve of the ways in which you plan to use and build on their ideas and content, both during and after the hackweek.
