# Travel

The Ronald Reagan Washington National Airport (DCA) offers a range of connections to the University of Maryland, College Park campus.

The Washinton, DC Metrorail connects Reagan Airport to the College Park Metrorail Station via the Yellow Line (15 stops, approximately 40 minutes). From that station, there are Mtero buses and UMD buses to campus, including #17

Taxis and uber/lyft rides are also available from the airport. 

# Lodging

Most participants from outside of the region will likely stay at a nearby Airbnb rental.

A courtesy block of rooms have been reserved at "The Hotel at the University of Maryland," which is on campus. An event code will be provided soon.
