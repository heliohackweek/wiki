# Travel

The Ronald Reagan Washington National Airport (DCA) offers a range of connections to the University of Maryland, College Park campus.

The Washinton, DC Metrorail connects Reagan Airport to the College Park Metrorail Station via the Yellow Line (15 stops, approximately 40 minutes). For directions from a DCA terminal to the Reagan Metrorail Station, see: [this link](https://www.flyreagan.com/dca/metrorail-station)

From the College Park Metrorail to the ESJ building on campus is 1/2 miles, walking, and there are buses running regularly from College Park station to campus, including Bus #17.

Taxis and uber/lyft rides are also available from the airport. 

# Lodging

Most participants from outside of the region will likely stay at a nearby Airbnb rental.

A courtesy block of rooms have been reserved at "The Hotel at the University of Maryland," which is on campus. An event code will be provided soon.
